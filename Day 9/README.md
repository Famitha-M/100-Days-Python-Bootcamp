# Day 9 - Dictionaries, Nesting, and the Blind Auction Program

## Dictionaries in Python
- Dictionaries store data in keyâ€“value pairs.
- Keys are unique identifiers, and values are the data associated with them.
- You can add, update, or loop through keys and values.

## Nesting Concepts
- A list can be nested inside a dictionary.
- A list can be nested inside another list.

## Blind Auction Program
- Create a program that simulates a blind auction.
- Each participant enters their name and bid.
- Store all bids in a dictionary.
- Continue asking until no more bidders remain.
- At the end, determine the highest bidder and declare the winner.
- Clear the screen between turns to hide bids.
