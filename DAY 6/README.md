# Day 6 - Functions in Python

## What is a Function?
A function is a wrapper name for a block of code.  
You define it once, and whenever you call it by its name, all the code inside executes.  
Functions help save time and reduce repeated code.

## Defining a Function
```python
def <function_name>():
    print("Hello")
    # Do something else
    # Do something else ...
